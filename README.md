# atomConfig

Here is my Atom config.
The keybindings are a weird conflation of native system and emacs -- you probably wouldn't like it much, TBH.

## PACKAGES
Since it's kind of icky to version control packages, here are some nice packages that I like:
* git-blame
* atom-beautify
* highlight-selected
* multi-cursor
* bracket-colorizer
* wrap-with-anything
* file-icons
* pigments
* fonts
* hyperclick
* js-hyperclick
* vue-hyperclick
* vuejs2-snippets
* language-vue
* autoclose-html
* multi-keymaps [git-controlled since my custom keymaps depend on it]
